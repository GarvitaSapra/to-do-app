<h1>To-Do List Application</h1>

<h2><b>Features</b></h2>

<h3>Mark tasks as completed: </h3> Click on a task to mark it as completed. Click again to unmark it.
<h3>Delete tasks: </h3>Click on the delete icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
<h3>Save tasks: </h3>Tasks are saved locally using the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
